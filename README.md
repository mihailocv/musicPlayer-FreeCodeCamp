# Music Player Project

This project is part of the "JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures" certification on freeCodeCamp. It aims to teach essential string and array methods like `find()`, `forEach()`, `map()`, and `join()`. These methods are crucial for developing dynamic web applications.

## Project Description

In this project, you'll code a basic MP3 player using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project covers fundamental concepts such as handling audio playback, managing a playlist, and implementing functionalities like play, pause, next, previous, and shuffle. You'll also learn how to dynamically update your user interface based on the current song.

## Features

- **Play/Pause**: Start or pause the current song.
- **Next/Previous**: Skip to the next or previous song in the playlist.
- **Shuffle**: Randomize the order of songs in the playlist.
- **Delete**: Remove a song from the playlist.
- **Reset Playlist**: Restore the original playlist if user deletes all songs.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the music player.
- **CSS**: Styling of the music player.
- **JavaScript**: Functionality and interactivity of the music player.

## How to Use

1. **Play a Song**: Click the play button to start playing the first song in the playlist. If a song is already playing, clicking the play button will restart it.
2. **Pause a Song**: Click the pause button to pause the current song.
3. **Next/Previous Song**: Use the next and previous buttons to navigate through the playlist.
4. **Shuffle Playlist**: Click the shuffle button to randomize the order of songs.
5. **Delete a Song**: Click the delete button next to a song to remove it from the playlist.
6. **Reset Playlist**: If the playlist is empty, a reset button will appear. Click it to restore the original playlist.

## Project Structure

- **index.html**: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the music player.
- **styles.css**: The CSS file that styles the music player.
- **script.js**: The JavaScript file that adds functionality to the music player.

## Learning Outcomes

By completing this project, you will:

- Gain a deeper understanding of string and array methods in JavaScript.
- Learn how to handle audio playback using JavaScript.
- Understand how to manage and manipulate a playlist.
- Learn how to dynamically update the user interface based on the current state.
